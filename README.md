### Factorial Analysis of Variance

A vegetation height of greater than 30 centimeters on a highway right-of-way is genereally considered a safety hazard to drivers. In the Landscape Ecology Journal, a study was conducted to find the effects of mowing frequency and mowing height on vegetation height along highway right-of-ways. A sample of 36 plots of land along a highway right-of-way were selected for the study and each were given a random mowing frequency/height treatment. Mowing frequency was set at three levels: once, twice, or three times per year and mowing height of equipment was also set at three levels: 5, 10, or 20 centimeters. At the end of the year, the vegetation height was recorded for each plot. We will conduct a 3x3 Factorial Anova to determine the effects of our two factors on the response variable and whether an interaction exists between our factors. Get the code here.
